/**
 * Thrown when multiple threads are competing for a lock and the lock timeout
 * interval is exceeded for the current operation. This is normally because
 * another transaction or cursor holds a lock for longer than the timeout
 * interval. It may also occur if the application fails to close a cursor, or
 * fails to commit or abort a transaction, since any locks held by the cursor
 * or transaction will be held indefinitely.
 *
 * <p>This exception is not thrown if a deadlock is detected, even if the
 * timeout elapses before the deadlock is broken. If a deadlock is detected,
 * {@link DeadlockException} is always thrown instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>The lock timeout interval may be set using
 * {@link EnvironmentConfig#setLockTimeout} or
 * {@link Transaction#setLockTimeout}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Transaction} handle is invalidated as a result of this
 * exception.</p>
 *
 * <p>Normally, applications should catch the base class {@link
 * LockConflictException} rather than catching one of its subclasses.  All lock
 * conflicts are typically handled in the same way, which is normally to abort
 * and retry the transaction.  See {@link LockConflictException} for more
 * information.</p>
