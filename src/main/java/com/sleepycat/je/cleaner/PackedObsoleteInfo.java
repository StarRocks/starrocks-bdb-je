/**
 * A sequence of obsolete info.
 *
 * To save memory, a TupleOutput is used to contain a sequence of {LSN-file,
 * LSN-offset} tuples. Packed integers are used and memory is saved by not
 * using an Object for each tuple, as would be needed in a Java collection.
 *
 * An OffsetList was not used because it does not use packed integers.
 * PackedOffsets was not used because it depends on offsets being sorted in
 * ascending order.
 *
 * Only obsolete IN LSNs are supported. LNs are not counted using this
 * approach.
