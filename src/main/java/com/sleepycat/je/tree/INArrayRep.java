/**
 * The base class for the various array representations used by fields
 * associated with an IN node. Storage efficiency, especially when JE is
 * operating in a "cache full" environment is the prime motivation for the
 * various representations.
 * <p>
 * Each representation assumes that all read operations are done under a shared
 * latch and all updates (set, copy and compact) are done under an exclusive
 * latch. As a result, the representations themselves do not make any
 * provisions for synchronization.
 * <p>
 * The callers of all the potentially representation mutating methods:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * {@link #set(int, Object, IN)}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #copy(int, int, int, IN)}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #compact(IN)}
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * must be careful to save the result value and use it for subsequent
 * operations, since it could represent the new mutated object.
