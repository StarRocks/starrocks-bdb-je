/**
 * A database cursor for a secondary database. Cursors are not thread safe and
 * the application is responsible for coordinating any multithreaded access to
 * a single cursor object.
 *
 * <p>Secondary cursors are returned by {@link SecondaryDatabase#openCursor
 * SecondaryDatabase.openCursor} and {@link
 * SecondaryDatabase#openSecondaryCursor
 * SecondaryDatabase.openSecondaryCursor}.  The distinguishing characteristics
 * of a secondary cursor are:</p>
 *
 * <ul> <li>Direct calls to <code>put()</code> methods on a secondary cursor
 * are prohibited.
 *
 * <li>The {@link #delete} method of a secondary cursor will delete the primary
 * record and as well as all its associated secondary records.
 *
 * <li>Calls to all get methods will return the data from the associated
 * primary database.
 *
 * <li>Additional get method signatures are provided to return the primary key
 * in an additional pKey parameter.
 *
 * <li>Calls to {@link #dup} will return a {@link SecondaryCursor}.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To obtain a secondary cursor with default attributes:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     SecondaryCursor cursor = myDb.openSecondaryCursor(txn, null);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>To customize the attributes of a cursor, use a CursorConfig object.</p>
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     CursorConfig config = new CursorConfig();
 *     config.setReadUncommitted(true);
 *     SecondaryCursor cursor = myDb.openSecondaryCursor(txn, config);

    /**
     * Reads the primary record associated with a secondary record.
     *
     * An approach is used for secondary DB access that avoids deadlocks that
     * would occur if locks were acquired on primary and secondary DBs in
     * different orders for different operations.  The primary DB lock must
     * always be acquired first when doing a write op; for example, when
     * deleting a primary record, we don't know what the secondary keys are
     * until we read (and lock) the primary record.  However, the natural way
     * to read via a secondary DB would be to read (and lock) the secondary
     * record first to obtain the primary key, and then read (and lock) the
     * primary record. Because this would obtain locks in the reverse order as
     * write ops, a different approach is used for secondary reads.
     *
     * In order to avoid deadlocks, for non-serializable isolation we change
     * the natural lock order for reads -- we only lock the primary record and
     * then check the secondary record's reference to primary record. The
     * initial read of the secondary DB is performed without acquiring locks
     * (dirty-read). The primary key is then used to read and lock the
     * associated primary record. At this point only the primary record is
     * locked.
     *
     * Then, the secondary reference is checked (see checkReferenceToPrimary in
     * Cursor). Note that there is no need to lock the secondary before
     * checking its reference to the primary, because during the check the
     * secondary is protected from changes by the lock on the primary. If we
     * discover that the secondary record has been deleted (for example, due to
     * an update to the primary after the secondary dirty-read and before the
     * primary locking read), the record will not be returned to the caller (it
     * will be skipped) and we will advance to the next record according to the
     * operation type. In this case the lock on the primary record is released.
     *
     * In addition, the READ_UNCOMMITTED_ALL mode is used for the dirty-read
     * of the secondary DB.  This ensures that we do not skip uncommitted
     * deleted records.  See LockMode.READ_UNCOMMITTED_ALL and
     * Cursor.readPrimaryAfterGet for further details.
     *
     * For a secondary DB with dups, READ_UNCOMMITTED_ALL will return a deleted
     * record for an open txn, and we'll discover the deletion when reading
     * (and locking) the primary record. The primary lookup is wasted in that
     * case, but this should be infrequent. For a secondary DB without dups,
     * READ_UNCOMMITTED_ALL will block during the secondary read in this case
     * (a deleted record for an open txn) in order to obtain the data (the
     * primary key).
     *
     * @return null if the primary record has been deleted or updated (when
     * using read-uncommitted), or the primary database has been removed from
     * the association. Otherwise, returns the result that should be returned
