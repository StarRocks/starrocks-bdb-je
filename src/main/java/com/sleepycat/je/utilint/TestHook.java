/**
 * TestHook is used to induce testing behavior that can't be provoked
 * externally.  For example, unit tests may use hooks to throw IOExceptions, or
 * to cause waiting behavior.
 *
 * To use this, a unit test should implement TestHook with a class that
 * overrides the desired method. The desired code will have a method that
 * allows the unit test to specify a hook, and will execute the hook if it is
 * non-null.  This should be done within an assert like so:
 *
 *    assert TestHookExecute(myTestHook);
 *
 * See Tree.java for examples.
