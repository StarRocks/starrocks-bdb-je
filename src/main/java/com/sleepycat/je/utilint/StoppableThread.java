/**
 * A StoppableThread is a daemon that obeys the following mandates:
 * - it sets the daemon property for the thread
 * - an uncaught exception handler is always registered
 * - the thread registers with the JE exception listener mechanism.
 * - its shutdown method can only be executed once. StoppableThreads are not
 *   required to implement shutdown() methods, because in some cases their
 *   shutdown processing must be coordinated by an owning, parent thread.
 *
 * StoppableThread is an alternative to the DaemonThread. It also assumes that
 * the thread's run() method may be more complex than that of the work-queue,
 * task oriented DaemonThread.
 *
 * A StoppableThread's run method should catch and handle all exceptions. By
 * default, unhandled exceptions are considered programming errors, and
 * invalidate the environment, but StoppableThreads may supply alternative
 * uncaught exception handling.
 *
 * StoppableThreads usually are created with an EnvironmentImpl, but on
 * occasion an environment may not be available (for components that can
 * execute without an environment). In that case, the thread obviously does not
 * invalidate the environment.
 *
 * Note that the StoppableThread.cleanup must be invoked upon, or soon after,
 * thread exit.
