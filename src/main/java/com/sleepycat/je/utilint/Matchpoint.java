/**
 * This class writes out a log entry that can be used for replication syncup.
 * It can be issued arbitrarily by the master at any point, in order to bound
 * the syncup interval in much the way that a checkpoint bounds the recovery
 * interval. The entry will a replicated one, which means that it will be
 * tagged with a VLSN.
 *
 * Although this is a replication class, it resides in the utilint package
 * because it is referenced in LogEntryType.java.
 *
 * TODO: This is currently not used. When it is used, it will be the first
 * replicated log entry that does not have a real txn id. All replicated
 * entries are expected to have negative ids, and the matchpoint should be
 * exempt from Replay.updateSequences, or it should pass in a special reserved
 * negative id, so as not to incur the assertion in Replay.updateSequences,
 * that the txn id is <0.
