 * Tag interface used to mark a Serializable class as being not intended for

 *
 * <p>Used mainly for internal exception classes that are handled internally
 * and never thrown to the app or serialized. A common hallmark of such
 * exceptions is a @SuppressWarnings("serial") annotation, indicating that
 * the class is really not serialized since a serialVersionUID field was not
 * added.</p>
 *
 * <p>May also be used for other internal classes that extend a Serializable
 * class, or implement an interface that extends Serializable, but are never
 * serialized.
