/**
 * Thrown by the {@link Environment#close()} when the current process must be
 * shut down and restarted before re-opening the Environment.
 * <p>
 * If during close(), a badly behaved internal thread cannot be stopped,
 * then the JVM process must be stopped and restarted. The close() method first
 * attempts a soft shutdown of each thread. If that fails to stop the thread,
 * it is interrupted. If that fails to stop the thread, because it never
 * becomes interruptible, then {@code EnvironmentWedgedException} is thrown by
 * close(), after performing as much of the normal shutdown process as
 * possible. Before this exception is thrown, a full thread dump is logged, to
 * aid in debugging.
 * <p>
 * Note that prior to calling close(), if JE attempts to shut down an internal
 * thread and it cannot be shut down, the Environment will be {@link
 * Environment#isValid() invalidated}, also causing an {@code
 * EnvironmentWedgedException} to be thrown. In this case (as in all other
 * cases where an {@link EnvironmentFailureException} is thrown and the
 * Environment is invalidated), the application should call {@link
 * Environment#close()}. The close() method will throw {@code
 * EnvironmentWedgedException} in this case, as described above.
 * <p>
 * If the application fails to restart the process when this exception is
 * thrown, it is likely that re-opening the Environment will not be possible,
 * or will result in unpredictable behavior. This is because the thread that
 * stopped may be holding a resource that is needed by the newly opened
 * Environment.
