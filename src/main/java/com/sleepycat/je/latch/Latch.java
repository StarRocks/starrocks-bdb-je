/**
 * Provides exclusive (mutex-like) latching. This is implemented with Java's
 * ReentrantLock, which is extended for a few reasons:
 * 1) To prevent reentrant use, since latches are not used reentrantly in JE.
 * This increases reliability by detecting accidental reentrant calls.
 * Checks for reentrancy are unconditional, i.e., checked in production.
 * 2) To support instrumentation for debugging (see LatchSupport).
 * 3) Automatic use of configured latch timeout.
 * 4) Built-in thread interrupt handling.
 *
 * Latches are expected to be held for short, defined periods of time.  No
 * deadlock detection is provided so it is the caller's responsibility to
 * sequence latch acquisition in an ordered fashion to avoid deadlocks.
