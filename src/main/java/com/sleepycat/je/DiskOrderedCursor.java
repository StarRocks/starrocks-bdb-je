/**
 * DiskOrderedCursor returns records in unsorted order in exchange for
 * generally faster retrieval times. Instead of key order, an approximation of
 * disk order is used, which results in less I/O. This can be useful when the
 * application needs to scan all records in one or more databases, and will be
 * applying filtering logic which does not need key ordered retrieval.
 * A DiskOrderedCursor is created using the {@link
 * Database#openCursor(DiskOrderedCursorConfig)} method or the {@link
 * Environment#openDiskOrderedCursor(Database[], DiskOrderedCursorConfig)}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * <em>WARNING:</em> After opening a DiskOrderedCursor, deletion of log files
 * by the JE log cleaner will be disabled until {@link #close()} is called.  To
 * prevent unbounded growth of disk usage, be sure to call {@link #close()} to
 * re-enable log file deletion.
 * <p>
 * <em>Optional configurations:</em> the following options are available to
 * tune the DiskOrderedCursor.
 * <p>
 * The DiskOrderedCursor creates a background producer thread which prefetches
 * some target records and inserts them in a queue for use by the cursor. The
 * parameter {@link EnvironmentConfig#DOS_PRODUCER_QUEUE_TIMEOUT} applies to
 * this background thread, and controls the timeout which governs the blocking
 * queue.
 * <p>
 * See {@link DiskOrderedCursorConfig} for additional options.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Consistency Guarantees</h3>
 * <p>
 * The consistency guarantees provided by a DiskOrderedCursor are, at best, the
 * same as those provided by READ_UNCOMMITTED (see {@link LockMode}).  With
 * READ_UNCOMMITTED, changes made by all transactions, including uncommitted
 * transactions, may be returned by the scan.  Also, a record returned by the
 * scan is not locked, and may be modified or deleted by the application after
 * it is returned, including modification or deletion of the record at the
 * cursor position.
 * <p>
 * In other words, the records returned by the scan correspond to the state
 * of the database (as if READ_UNCOMMITTED were used) at the beginning of the
 * scan plus some, but not all, changes made by the application after the start
 * of the scan.  The user should not rely on the scan returning any changes
 * made after the start of the scan.  For example, if the record referred to by
 * the DiskOrderedCursor is deleted after the DiskOrderedCursor is positioned
 * at that record, getCurrent() will still return the key and value of that
 * record and OperationStatus.SUCCESS.
 * 
 * If a transactionally correct data set is required (as defined by
 * READ_COMMITTED), the application must ensure that all transactions that
 * write to the database are committed before the beginning of the scan.
 * During the scan, no records in the database of the scan may be
 * inserted, deleted, or modified.  While this is possible, it is not the
 * expected use case for a DiskOrderedCursor.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Performance Considerations</h3>
 * <p>
 * The internal algorithm used to approximate disk ordered reads is as follows.
 * For simplicity, the algorithm description assumes that a single database is
 * being scanned, but the algorithm is almost the same when multiple databases
 * are involved.  
 * An internal producer thread is used to scan the database. This thread is
 * created and started when the {@code DiskOrderedCursor} is created, and is
 * destroyed by {@link DiskOrderedCursor#close}. Scanning consists of two
 * phases.  In phase I the in-cache Btree of the scanned database is traversed
 * in key order.  The LSNs (physical record addresses) of the data to be
 * fetched are accumulated in a memory buffer.  Btree latches are held during
 * the traversal, but only for short durations.  In phase II the accumulated
 * LSNs are sorted into disk order, fetched one at a time in that order, and
 * the fetched data is added to a blocking queue.  The {@code getNext} method
 * in this class removes the next entry from the queue.  This approach allows
 * concurrent access to the Database during both phases of the scan, including
 * access by the application's consumer thread (the thread calling {@code
 * getNext}).
 * <p>
 * Phase I does not always process the entire Btree.  During phase I if the
 * accumulation of LSNs causes the {@link
 * DiskOrderedCursorConfig#setInternalMemoryLimit internal memory limit} or
 * {@link DiskOrderedCursorConfig#setLSNBatchSize LSN batch size} to be
 * exceeded, phase I is ended and phase II begins.  In this case, after phase
 * II finishes, phase I resumes where it left off in the Btree traversal.
 * Phase I and II are repeated until the entire database is scanned.
 * <p>
 * By default, the internal memory limit and LSN batch size are unbounded (see
 * {@link DiskOrderedCursorConfig}).  For a database with a large number of
 * records, this could cause an {@code OutOfMemoryError}.  Therefore, it is
 * strongly recommended that either the internal memory limit or LSN batch size
 * is configured to limit the use of memory during the scan.  On the other
 * hand, the efficiency of the scan is proportional to the amount of memory
 * used.  If enough memory is available, the ideal case would be that the
 * database is scanned in in a single iteration of phase I and II.  The more
 * iterations, the more random IO will occur.
 * <p>
 * Another factor is the {@link DiskOrderedCursorConfig#setQueueSize queue
 * size}.  During the phase I Btree traversal, data that is resident in the JE
 * cache will be added to the queue immediately, rather than waiting until
 * phase II and fetching it, but only if the queue is not full.  Therefore,
 * increasing the size of the queue can avoid fetching data that is resident in
 * the JE cache.  Also, increasing the queue size can improve parallelism of
 * the work done by the producer and consumer threads.
 * <p>
 * Also note that a {@link DiskOrderedCursorConfig#setKeysOnly keys-only} scan
 * is much more efficient than the default keys-and-data scan.  With a
 * keys-only scan, only the BINs (bottom internal nodes) of the Btree need to
 * be fetched; the LNs (leaf nodes) do not.  This is also true of databases
 * {@link DatabaseConfig#setSortedDuplicates configured for duplicates}, even
 * for a keys-and-data scan, since internally the key and data are both
 * contained in the BIN.
