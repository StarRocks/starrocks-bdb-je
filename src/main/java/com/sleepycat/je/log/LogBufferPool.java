/**
 * LogBufferPool manages a circular pool of LogBuffers.
 * The currentWriteBuffer is the buffer that is currently
 * used to add data.  When the buffer is full, the next (adjacent)
 * buffer is made available for writing. The buffer pool has a dirty
 * list of buffers. A buffer becomes a member of the dirty list when the
 * currentWriteBuffer is moved to another buffer. Buffers are removed
 * from the dirty list when they are written.
 * The dirtyStart/dirtyEnd variables indicate the list of dirty buffers.
 * A value of -1 for either variables indicates that there are no dirty
 * buffers. These variable are synchronized via the
 * LogBufferPool.bufferPoolLatch. The LogManager.logWriteLatch (aka LWL)
 * is used to serialize access to the currentWriteBuffer, so that entries are
 * added in write/LSN order.
 *
 * A buffer used for writing is accessed by the getWriteBuffer method.
 * This method must be called while holding the LWL. The buffer returned
 * is not latched.
 *
 * A LogBuffer has a pin count (LogBuffer.writePinCount) associated with
 * it. The pin count is incremented when space is allocated in the buffer.
 * The allocation of space is serialized under the LWL. Threads will add
 * data to the buffer by latching the buffer, but without holding the LWL.
 * After the data is added, the pin count is decremented. A buffer cannot be
 * used for reading unless the pin count is zero. It should be noted that the
 * increment of the pin count is done with the buffer latched. The decrement
 * does not latch the buffer.
 *
 * Read access to a log buffer is allowed only if the buffer is latched
 * and the pin count is zero. A thread that attempt to access a log
 * buffer for reading will latch and check the pin count. If the pin
 * count is not zero, the latch is released and the process is retried.
 * The thread attempting to access the log buffer for reading may be delayed.
 * The worst case is when the reader has to wait until the buffer
 * is filled (the pin count would be zero).
