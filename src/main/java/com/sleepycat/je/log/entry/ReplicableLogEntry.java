/**
 * A sub-interface of {@link LogEntry} that must be implemented by all log
 * entries that can be replicated.  Replicable log entries are all those
 * entries for which the associated {@link LogEntryType}'s {@link
 * LogEntryType#isReplicationPossible} method returns {@code true}.  These are
 * the log entries that can be included in the replication stream distributed
 * from feeders to replicas during replication.  See [#22336].
 *
 * <p>Starting with the release using log version 9, as specified by {@link
 * LogEntryType#LOG_VERSION_REPLICATE_OLDER}, all replicable log entries
 * need to support writing themselves in earlier log formats, to support
 * replication during an upgrade when the master is replicated first.  Any
 * loggable objects that they reference should also implement {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.log.VersionedWriteLoggable} for the same reason.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getLastFormatChange} method identifies the log version for
 * which the entry's log format has most recently changed.  This information is
 * used to determine if the current log format is compatible with a
 * non-upgraded replica.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getSize(int, boolean)} method overloading is used when
 * creating the buffer that will be used to transmit the log entry data in the
 * earlier format.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #writeEntry(ByteBuffer, int, boolean)} method overloading is
 * used to convert the in-memory format of the log entry into the log data in
 * the earlier format.
 *
 * <p>To simplify the implementation of writing log entries in multiple log
 * version formats, a log entry that needs to be written in a previous format
 * will first be read into its in-memory format in the current version, and
 * then written from there to the previous format.

     * the minimum of its current value and X.LAST_FORMAT_CHANGE.
