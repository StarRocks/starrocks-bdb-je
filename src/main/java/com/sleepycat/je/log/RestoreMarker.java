/**
 * A RestoreMarker is a file that indicates that a normal recovery is not
 * possible, because the log files are physically or semantically inconsistent
 * in some way.
 *
 * One example is an interrupted, incomplete network restore.  The network
 * restore copies log files from a source to destination node. If it's halted,
 * while the destination node may contain files that are readable,
 * checksum-able and seem correct, the set as a whole may not have a complete
 * and coherent copy of the log. In such a case, recovery should not be run on
 * this environment's log until some action is taken to make it consistent. For
 * a network restore, this curative action is to restart the copy process, and
 * to complete the copy of a set of logs from some node to this node. The
 * network restore creates a marker file just before it does any form of change
 * to the log that would make the log inconsistent.
 *
 * The restore marker file is named <MAXINT>.jdb, and holds a normal log file
 * header and a RestoreRequired log entry. The RestoreRequired entry indicates
 * the type of error of the initial cause, and information needed to repair the
 * environment. The mechanism depends on the fact that the very first step of
 * recovery is to read backwards from the last file in the
 * environment. Recovery will start at this file, and will fail when it reads
 * the RestoreRequired log entry, throwing an exception that contains
 * prescriptive information for how the environment can be repaired.
 *
 * Note that createMarkerFile() is idempotent and can be safely called multiple
 * times. It's done that way to make it simpler for the caller.
 *
 * The handler that repairs the log must also delete the marker file so future
 * recoveries can succeed.
