/**
 * Thrown when the transaction timeout interval is exceeded. This is normally
 * because the cumulative operation time for the transaction exceeds the
 * timeout, or another transaction or cursor holds a lock for longer than the
 * timeout interval. It may also occur if the application fails to close a
 * cursor, or fails to commit or abort a transaction, since any locks held by
 * the cursor or transaction will be held indefinitely.
 *
 * <p>This exception is not thrown if a deadlock is detected, even if the
 * timeout elapses before the deadlock is broken. If a deadlock is detected,
 * {@link DeadlockException} is always thrown instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>The transaction timeout interval may be set using
 * {@link Transaction#setTxnTimeout}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Transaction} handle is invalidated as a result of this
 * exception.</p>
 *
 * <p>Normally, applications should catch the base class {@link
 * LockConflictException} rather than catching one of its subclasses.  All lock
 * conflicts are typically handled in the same way, which is normally to abort
 * and retry the transaction.  See {@link LockConflictException} for more
 * information.</p>
