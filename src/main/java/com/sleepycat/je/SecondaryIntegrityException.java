/**
 * Thrown when an integrity problem is detected while accessing a secondary
 * database, including access to secondaries while writing to a primary
 * database. Secondary integrity problems are normally caused by the use of
 * secondaries without transactions.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Transaction} handle is invalidated as a result of this
 * exception. In addition, the corrupt index (secondary database) is marked
 * as corrupt in memory. All subsequent access to the index will throw
 * {@code SecondaryIntegrityException}. To correct the problem, the
 * application may perform a full restore (an HA {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.rep.NetworkRestore} or restore from backup) or rebuild
 * the corrupt index.</p>
 *
 * <p>Some possible causes of a secondary integrity exception are listed
 * below.  Note that only the first item -- the use of a non-transactional
 * store -- is applicable when using the {@link com.sleepycat.persist DPL}.
 * All other items below do not apply to the use of the DPL, because the DPL
 * ensures that secondary databases are configured and managed correctly.</p>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>The use of non-transactional databases or stores can cause secondary
 *  corruption as described in <a
 *  href="SecondaryDatabase.html#transactions">Special considerations for using
 *  Secondary Databases with and without Transactions</a>.  Secondary databases
 *  and indexes should always be used in conjunction with transactional
 *  databases and stores.</li>
 *
 *  <li>Secondary corruption can be caused by an incorrectly implemented
 *  secondary key creator method, for example, one which uses mutable state
 *  information or is not properly synchronized.  When the DPL is not used, the
 *  application is responsible for correctly implementing the key creator.</li>
 *
 *  <li>Secondary corruption can be caused by failing to open a secondary
 *  database before writing to the primary database, by writing to a secondary
 *  database directly using a {@link Database} handle, or by truncating or
 *  removing primary database without also truncating or removing all secondary
 *  databases.  When the DPL is not used, the application is responsible for
 *  managing associated databases correctly.</p>
