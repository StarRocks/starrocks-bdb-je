/**
 * Verifies the checksums in an {@code InputStream} for a log file in a JE
 * {@code Environment}.
 *
 * <p>This {@code InputStream} reads input from some other given {@code
 * InputStream}, and verifies checksums while reading.  Its primary intended
 * use is to verify log files that are being copied as part of a programmatic
 * backup.  It is critical that invalid files are not added to a backup set,
 * since then both the live environment and the backup will be invalid.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following example verifies log files as they are being copied.  The
 * {@link DbBackup} class should normally be used to obtain the array of files
 * to be copied.</p>

 * <!-- NOTE: Whenever the method below is changed, update the copy in
 * VerifyLogTest to match, so that it will be tested. -->
