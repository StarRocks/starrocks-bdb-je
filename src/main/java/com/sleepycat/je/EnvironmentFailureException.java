/**
 * Indicates that a failure has occurred that could impact the {@code
 * Environment} as a whole.  For failures that impact only the current
 * operation and/or transaction, see {@link OperationFailureException}).  For
 * an overview of all exceptions thrown by JE, see {@link DatabaseException}.
 *
 * <p>Depending on the nature of the failure, this exception may indicate that
 * {@link Environment#close} must be called. The application should catch
 * {@code EnvironmentFailureException} and then call {@link
 * Environment#isValid}.  If {@code false} is returned, all {@code Environment}
 * handles (instances) must be closed and re-opened in order to run recovery
 * and continue operating.  If {@code true} is returned, the {@code
 * Environment} can continue operating without being closed and re-opened.
 * Also note that {@link Environment#isValid} may be called at any time, not
 * just during exception handling.</p>
 *
 * <p>The use of the {@link Environment#isValid} method allows JE to determine
 * dynamically whether the failure requires recovery or not, and allows for
 * this determination to change in future releases.  Over time, internal
 * improvements to error handling may allow more error conditions to be handled
 * without invalidating the {@code Environment}.</p>
 *
 * <p>(Although this exception class extends {@link RunRecoveryException}, it
 * does not always indicate that recovery is necessary, as described above.
 * {@code RunRecoveryException} has been deprecated and {@code
 * EnvironmentFailureException} should be used instead.)</p>
 *
 * <p>If an {@code EnvironmentFailureException} consistently occurs soon after
 * opening the Environment, this may indicate a persistent problem.  It may
 * indicate a system problem or a persistent storage problem.  In this case,
 * human intervention is normally required and restoring from a backup may be
 * necessary.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that subclasses of {@code EnvironmentFailureException} indicate how
 * to handle the exception in more specific ways.</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If {@code Thread.interrupt} is called for a thread performing JE
 * operations, a {@link ThreadInterruptedException} is thrown.  Since
 * interrupting a thread is intentional, it does not indicate a persistent
 * problem and human intervention is not normally required.
 * </li>
 * <li>If an {@code IOException} occurs while writing to the JE log, a
 * {@link LogWriteException} is thrown.  Although an {@code IOException} can
 * occur for different reasons, it is a hint that the disk may be full and
 * applications may wish to attempt recovery after making more disk space
 * available.
 * </li>
 * <li>For replicated environments, see the subclasses of {@code
 * EnvironmentFailureException} in the {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep} package for
 * more information.  Such exceptions may require special handling.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If {@link Environment#close} is not called after an {@code
 * EnvironmentFailureException} invalidates the {@code Environment}, all
 * subsequent method calls for the {@code Environment} will throw the same
 * exception.  This provides more than one opportunity to catch and handle the
 * specific exception subclass that caused the failure.</p>
