/**
 * Thrown when an attempt to write a primary database record would insert a

 * one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
 *
 * <p>When using the base API ({@code com.sleepycat.je}), this can occur when a
 * {@link SecondaryDatabase} is not configured to allow duplicate keys (which
 * is the default, see {@link DatabaseConfig#setSortedDuplicates}). This
 * implies the use of a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.</p>
 *
 * <p>When using the DPL ({@code com.sleepycat.persist}), this can occur when a
 * {@link com.sleepycat.persist.model.SecondaryKey} is defined with a {@link
 * com.sleepycat.persist.model.Relationship#ONE_TO_ONE} or {@link
 * com.sleepycat.persist.model.Relationship#ONE_TO_MANY} relationship.</p>
