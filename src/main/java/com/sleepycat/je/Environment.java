/**
 * A database environment.  Environments include support for some or all of
 * caching, locking, logging and transactions.
 *
 * <p>To open an existing environment with default attributes the application
 * may use a default environment configuration object or null:
 * <blockquote>
 *     <pre>
 *      // Open an environment handle with default attributes.
 *     Environment env = new Environment(home, new EnvironmentConfig());
 *     </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * or
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     Environment env = new Environment(home, null);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>Note that many Environment objects may access a single environment.</p>
 * <p>To create an environment or customize attributes, the application should
 * customize the configuration class. For example:</p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     EnvironmentConfig envConfig = new EnvironmentConfig();
 *     envConfig.setTransactional(true);
 *     envConfig.setAllowCreate(true);
 *     envConfig.setCacheSize(1000000);
 *     Environment newlyCreatedEnv = new Environment(home, envConfig);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Note that environment configuration parameters can also be set through
 * the &lt;environment home&gt;/je.properties file. This file takes precedence
 * over any programmatically specified configuration parameters so that
 * configuration changes can be made without recompiling. Environment
 * configuration follows this order of precedence:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Configuration parameters specified in
 * &lt;environment home&gt;/je.properties take first precedence.
 * <li> Configuration parameters set in the EnvironmentConfig object used at
 * Environment construction e   tameters not set by the application are set to
 * system defaults, described along with the parameter name String constants
 * in the EnvironmentConfig class.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>An <em>environment handle</em> is an Environment instance.  More than one
 * Environment instance may be created for the same physical directory, which
 * is the same as saying that more than one Environment handle may be open at
 * one time for a given environment.</p>
 *
 * The Environment handle should not be closed while any other handle remains
 * open that is using it as a reference (for example, {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.Database Database} or {@link com.sleepycat.je.Transaction
 * Transaction}.  Once {@link com.sleepycat.je.Environment#close
 * Environment.close} is called, this object may not be accessed again.

     * The Environment.close method closes the Berkeley DB environment.
     *
     * <p>When the last environment handle is closed, allocated resources are
     * freed, and daemon threads are stopped, even if they are performing work.
     * For example, if the cleaner is still cleaning the log, it will be
     * stopped at the next reasonable opportunity and perform no more cleaning
     * operations. After stopping background threads, a final checkpoint is
     * performed by this method, in order to reduce the time to recover the
     * next time the environment is opened.</p>
     *
     * <p>When minimizing recovery time is desired, it is often useful to stop
     * all application activity and perform an additional checkpoint prior to
     * calling {@code close}. This additional checkpoint will write most of
     * dirty Btree information, so that that the final checkpoint is very
     * small (and recovery is fast). To ensure that recovery time is minimized,
     * the log cleaner threads should also be stopped prior to the extra
     * checkpoint. This prevents log cleaning from dirtying the Btree, which
     * can make the final checkpoint larger (and recovery time longer). The
     * recommended procedure for minimizing recovery time is:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *     // Stop/finish all application operations that are using JE.
     *     ...
     *
     *     // Stop the cleaner daemon threads.

     *     config.setConfigParam(EnvironmentConfig.ENV_RUN_CLEANER, "false");
     *     env.setMutableConfig(config);
     *
     *     // Perform an extra checkpoint
     *     env.checkpoint(new CheckpointConfig().setForce(true));
     *
     *     // Finally, close the environment.
     *     env.close();
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>The Environment handle should not be closed while any other handle
     * that refers to it is not yet closed; for example, database environment
     * handles must not be closed while database handles remain open, or
     * transactions in the environment have not yet committed or aborted.
     * Specifically, this includes {@link com.sleepycat.je.Database Database},
     * and {@link com.sleepycat.je.Transaction Transaction} handles.</p>
     *
     * <p>If this handle has already been closed, this method does nothing and
     * returns without throwing an exception.</p>
     *
     * <p>In multithreaded applications, only a single thread should call
     * Environment.close.</p>
     *
     * <p>The environment handle may not be used again after this method has
     * been called, regardless of the method's success or failure, with one
     * exception:  the {@code close} method itself may be called any number of
     * times.</p>
     *
     * <p>WARNING: To guard against memory leaks, the application should
     * discard all references to the closed handle.  While BDB makes an effort
     * to discard references from closed objects to the allocated memory for an
     * environment, this behavior is not guaranteed.  The safe course of action

     * <p>
     * For a non-replicated DB, an auto-commit txn must be created by calling
     * LockerFactory.getWritableLocker with the autoTxnIsReplicated param set
     * to false.  If autoTxnIsReplicated is set to true in a replicated
     * environment, HA consistency checks will be made when the txn is begun

     * unknown state, the consistency checks would fail and prevent performing
     * the operation on the local/non-replicated DB.
     * <p>
     * Unfortunately, we need to create a txn/locker in order to query the DB
     * metadata, to determine whether it is replicated.  Therefore, we always
     * attempt the operation initially with autoTxnIsReplicated set to false.
     * The DbTree name operation methods (see DbTree.lockNameLN) will throw an
     * internal exception (NeedRepLockerException) if a non-replicated
     * auto-commit txn is used on a replicated DB.  That signals this class to
     * retry the operation with autoTxnIsReplicated set to true.
     * <p>
     * Via an unlikely series of DB renaming it is possible that on the 2nd try
     * with a replicated txn, we find that the DB is non-replicated.  However,
     * there is little harm in proceeding, since the consistency check is
     * already done.

     * (using the {@link EnvironmentConfig#ENV_RUN_CLEANER} property)
     * for maximum performance during active periods, and calls {@code

     * some applications may wish to perform batch cleaning prior to closing
     * the environment, to reclaim as much disk space as possible at that
     * time.</p>
     *
     * <p>To clean until the target utilization threshold is reached, {@code

     * When there is a large {@link EnvironmentStats#getCleanerBacklog
     * backlog} of files to be cleaned, the application may wish to limit the
     * amount of cleaning. Batch cleaning can be aborted simply by breaking out
     * of the loop. The cleaning of a single file is not a long operation; it
     * should take several minutes at most. For example:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *     boolean cleaningAborted;
     *     boolean anyCleaned = false;
     *
     *     while (!cleaningAborted && env.cleanLogFile()) {
     *         anyCleaned = true;
     *     }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Note that in certain unusual situations the cleaner may not be able
     * to make forward progress and the target utilization will never be
     * reached. For example, this can occur if the target utilization is set
     * too high or checkpoints are performed too often. To guard against
     * cleaning "forever", the application may wish to cancel the batch
     * cleaning (break out of the loop) when the cleaning time or number of
     * files cleaned exceeds some reasonable limit.</p>
     *
     * <p>As mentioned above, the cleaned log files will not be deleted until
     * the next full checkpoint. If the application wishes to reclaim this disk
     * space as soon as possible, an explicit checkpoint may be performed after
     * the batch cleaning operation. For example:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *     if (anyCleaned) {
     *         env.checkpoint(new CheckpointConfig().setForce(true));
     *     }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>However, even an explicit checkpoint is not guaranteed to delete the
     * cleaned log files if, at the time the file was cleaned, records in the
     * file were locked or were part of a database that was being removed, due
     * to concurrent application activity that was accessing records or
     * removing databases. In this case the files will be deleted only after
     * these operations are complete and a subsequent checkpoint is performed.
     * To guarantee that the cleaned files will be deleted, an application may
     * stop all concurrent activity (ensure all operations and transactions
     * have ended) and then perform a checkpoint.</p>
     *
     * <p>When closing the environment and minimizing recovery time is desired
     * (see {@link #close}), as well as reclaiming disk space, the recommended
     * procedure is as follows:</p>

     * <pre>
     *     // Stop/finish all application operations that are using JE.
