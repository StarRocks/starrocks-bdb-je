/**
 * In the past, MasterReplicaTransitionException was sometimes thrown in JE 
 * replication systems when an environment that was a master and transitioned 
 * to replica state. In some cases, the environment had to reinitialize 
 * internal state to become a replica, and the application was required to
 * the application close and reopen its environment handle, thereby
 * properly reinitializing the node.
 * <p>
 * As of JE 5.0.88, the environment can transition from master to replica
 * without requiring an environment close and re-open.
 * @deprecated as of JE 5.0.88 because the environment no longer needs to
 * restart when transitioning from master to replica.
