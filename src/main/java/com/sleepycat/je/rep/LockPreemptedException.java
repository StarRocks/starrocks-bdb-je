/**
 * Thrown when a lock has been "stolen", or preempted, from a transaction in a
 * replicated environment.
 *
 * <p>The {@link com.sleepycat.je.Transaction} handle is invalidated as a
 * result of this exception.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Locks may be preempted in a JE HA environment on a Replica system when
 * the HA write operation needs a lock that an application reader transaction
 * or cursor holds.  This exception is thrown by a reader transaction or cursor
 * method that is called after a lock has been preempted.</p>
 *
 * <p>Normally, applications should catch the base class {@link
 * LockConflictException} rather than catching one of its subclasses.  All lock
 * conflicts are typically handled in the same way, which is normally to abort
 * and retry the transaction.  See {@link LockConflictException} for more
 * information.</p>
