/**
 * SimpleTxnMap provides a customized (but limited functionality) map that's
 * well suited to the tracking of open transactions. Transactions are entered
 * into this map when they are first created, referenced while they are alive
 * via their transaction id and subsequently, removed upon commit or abort. So
 * the map access pattern for each transaction looks like the sequence:
 *
 * put [get]* remove
 *
 * For JE applications, like KVS, transactions can pass through this map at the
 * rate of 30K to 60K transactions/sec, so the map needs to process these
 * operations efficiently.
 *
 * This map tries to be efficient for the put, get, remove operations by:
 *
 * 1) Avoiding any memory allocation for the typical: put, get, remove
 * sequence. In contrast, a heap entry uses 24 bytes for each entry plus 16
 * bytes for the long object argument when using compressed oops. It could be
 * that the heap storage could be replaced by stack storage for the long object
 * argument since it's a downward lexical funarg, but I don't know if the jvm
 * does such analysis.
 *
 * 2) Having a very short instruction code path for the typical case.
 *
 * The data structure used here is very simple, and consists of two maps.
 *
 * 1) An array based map indexed by the low bits of the transaction id.
 *
 * 2) A regular java Map
 *
 * The array based map is the preferred location for map entries. If the slot
 * associated with the transaction id is occupied, we fall back to the the java
 * Map.
 *
 * So the best case behavior is as if the map were implemented entirely as an
 * array and the worst case is that we will do an extra integer mask, array
 * index and compare operation before we resort to using the java Map. Given
 * the behavior of transactions, we expect that the vast majority of the
 * operations will be implemented by the array map.
 *
 * This class provides a minimal subset of the operations provided by Map. All
 * methods are synchronized. This works well for replica replay in conjunction
 * with a jvm's thread biased locking strategy, but we may need explicit locks
 * for other usage.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of Txn object stored as values in the map
