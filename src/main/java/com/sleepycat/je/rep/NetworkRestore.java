/**
 * Obtains log files for a Replica from other members of the replication
 * group. A Replica may need to do so if it has been offline for some time, and
 * has fallen behind in its execution of the replication stream.
 * <p>
 * During that time, the connected nodes may have reduced their log files by
 * deleting files after doing log cleaning. When this node rejoins the group,
 * it is possible that the current Master's log files do not go back far enough
 * to adequately {@link <a
 * href="{@docRoot}/../ReplicationGuide/lifecycle.html#lifecycle-nodestartup">
 * sync * up</a>} this node. In that case, the node can use a {@code
 * NetworkRestore} object to copy the log files from one of the nodes in the
 * group. The system tries to avoid deleting log files that either would be
 * needed for replication by current nodes or where replication would be more
 * efficient than network restore.
 * <p>
 * A Replica discovers the need for a NetworkRestore operation when a call to
 * {@code ReplicatedEnvironment()} fails with a {@link
 * InsufficientLogException}.
 * <p>
 * A call to {@code NetworkRestore.execute()} will copy the required log
 * files from a member of the group who owns the files and seems to be the
 * least busy. For example:
 * <pre class=code>
 *  try {
 *     node = new ReplicatedEnvironment(envDir, envConfig, repConfig);
 * } catch (InsufficientLogException insufficientLogEx) {
 *
 *     NetworkRestore restore = new NetworkRestore();
 *     NetworkRestoreConfig config = new NetworkRestoreConfig();
 *     config.setRetainLogFiles(false); // delete obsolete log files.
 *
 *     // Use the members returned by insufficientLogEx.getLogProviders() to
 *     // select the desired subset of members and pass the resulting list
 *     // as the argument to config.setLogProviders(), if the default selection
 *     // of providers is not suitable.
 *
 *     restore.execute(insufficientLogEx, config);
 *
 *     // retry
 *     node = new ReplicatedEnvironment(envDir, envConfig, repConfig);
 * }
 * </pre>

     * Algorithm
     * =========
     * If we simply choose the server with the highest maxVSLN, we would
     * always choose the master, which is typically the server with the
     * highest load. If we choose based on load alone, we may choose a
     * lagging replica, and this may result in syncup failing later on the
     * restored server. The compromise solution involves maxLag. We don't
     * select servers less than maxLag behind the master (the server with the
     * highest VLSN range end) to increase the chances of syncup working
     * later, and among the non-lagging servers we choose the lowest load.
     *
     * 1. Collect list of servers and get their load/rangeEnd using the
     *    first part of the restore protocol. For each server, its load is its
     *    number of feeders and rangeEnd is the upper end of its VLSN range.
     *    Remove unresponsive servers from the list.
     *
     * 2. At the beginning of each round, if the server list is empty, give up.
     *
     * 3. Sort list by load. Let minVLSN be max(all rangeEnds) minus maxLag.
     *
     * 4. Attempt to perform restore in list order, refreshing each server's
     *    load/rangeEnd as we go. Reject any server with a refreshed rangeEnd
     *    that is LT minVLSN or a refreshed load that is GT its prior known
     *    load. Remove unresponsive servers from the list.
     *
     * 5. If the restore is incomplete, goto 2 and do another round.
     *
     * Note that between rounds the load and minVLSN of each server can
     * change, which is why servers are not removed from the list unless
     * they are unresponsive. The idea is to choose the best server based on
     * the information we collected in the last round, but reject servers
     * with new load or rangeEnd values that invalidate the earlier decision,
     * and always get fresh load/rangeEnd values for each server.
     *
     * @param logException the exception packing information driving the
     * restore operation.
     * @param config may contain an explicit list of members.
