/**
 * This exception indicates that the log files constituting the Environment are
 * insufficient and cannot be used as the basis for continuing with the
 * replication stream provided by the current master.
 * <p>
 * This exception is typically thrown by the ReplicatedEnvironment constructor
 * when a node has been down for a long period of time and is being started up
 * again. It may also be thrown when a brand new node attempts to become a
 * member of the group and it does not have a sufficiently current set of log
 * files. If the group experiences sustained network connectivity problems,
 * this exception may also be thrown by an active Replica that has been unable
 * to stay in touch with the members of its group for an extended period of
 * time.
 * <p>
 * In the typical case, application handles the exception by invoking
 * {@link NetworkRestore#execute} to obtain the log files it needs from one of
 * the members of the replication group. After the log files are obtained, the
 * node recreates its environment handle and resumes participation as an active
 * member of the group.
