/**
 * This asynchronous exception indicates that a new master has been selected,
 * this <code>Replica</code>'s log is ahead of the current <code>Master</code>,
 * and in this case, the <code>Replica</code> was unable to rollback without a
 * recovery. As a consequence, it is possible that one or more of the most
 * recently committed transactions may need to be rolled back, before the
 * <code>Replica</code> can synchronize its state with that of the current
 * <code>Master</code>. Note that any CommitTokens obtained before restarting
 * this <code>Replica</code> shouldn't be used after {@link RollbackException}
 * is thrown because the token may no longer exist on the current
 * <code>Master</code> node, due to failover processing.
 * <p>
 * Existing {@link ReplicatedEnvironment}, and consequently {@link Database}
 * handles, are invalidated as a result of this exception. The application must
 * close all old handles and create new handles before it can proceed. The
 * actual rollback of any recently committed transactions is done when the
 * application re-instantiates and thereby reopens the {@link
 * ReplicatedEnvironment}.  The application is responsible for discarding and
 * recreating any transient state that may be associated with the committed
 * transactions that were rolled back. {@link #getEarliestTransactionId} and 
 * {@link #getEarliestTransactionCommitTime} provide information to help
 * determine which transactions might be rolled back. Note that it is possible
 * that no committed transactions have been rolled back and that the 
 * application need do no adjustments, in which case 
 * {@link #getEarliestTransactionCommitTime} will return null.
 * <p>
 * This exception should be encountered relatively infrequently in practice,
 * since the election mechanism favors nodes with the most advanced log when
 * deciding upon a master. The exception, due to its nature, can only be
 * encountered when the node is in the <code>Replica</code> state, or the node
 * is trying to transition to the <code>Replica</code> state.
 * <p>
 * Use of weak durability requirements like
 * {@link com.sleepycat.je.Durability.ReplicaAckPolicy#NONE} or a
 * {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicationMutableConfig#NODE_PRIORITY} of zero
 * increases the likelihood of this exception.
