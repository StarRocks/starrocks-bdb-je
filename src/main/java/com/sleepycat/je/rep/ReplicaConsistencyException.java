/**
 * This exception is thrown by a Replica to indicate it could not meet the
 * consistency requirements as defined by the
 * <code>ReplicaConsistencyPolicy</code> in effect for the transaction, within
 * the allowed timeout period.
 * <p>
 * A Replica will typically keep current with its Master. However, network
 * problems, excessive load on the Master, or Replica, may prevent the Replica
 * from keeping up and the Replica may fall further behind than is permitted by
 * its consistency policy. If the Replica cannot catch up in the time defined
 * by its <code>ReplicaConsistencyPolicy</code>, it will throw this exception
 * from the {@link com.sleepycat.je.Environment#beginTransaction
 * Environment.beginTransaction} method, thus preventing the transaction from
 * accessing data that does not meet its consistency requirements.
 * <p>
 * If this exception is encountered frequently, it indicates that the
 * consistency policy requirements are too strict and cannot be met routinely
 * given the load being placed on the system and the hardware resources that
 * are available to service the load. The exception may also indicate that
 * there is a network related issue that is preventing the Replica from
 * communicating with the master and keeping up with the replication stream.
 * <p>
 * The application can choose to retry the transaction, until the underlying
 * system problem has been resolved. Or it can try relaxing the consistency
 * constraints, or choose the {@link NoConsistencyRequiredPolicy} so that the
 * constraints can be satisfied more easily.
 * For example, in a {@link <a href=
 * "{@docRoot}/../ReplicationGuide/lifecycle.html#twonode"> two node
 * replication group</a>}, if the primary goes down, the application may want
 * the secondary node to continue to service read requests, and will lower the
 * consistency requirement on that node in order to maintain read availability.
