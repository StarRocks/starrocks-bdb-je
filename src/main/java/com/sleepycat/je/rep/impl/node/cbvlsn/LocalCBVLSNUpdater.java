/**
 * The methods in this class are disabled if the GlobalCBVLSN is defunct -- see
 * {@link GlobalCBVLSN}.
 *
 * <p>When the GlobalCBVLSN is not defunct, this class supports updating the
 * group database with each node's local CBVLSN when it is in the Master
 * state. There is one instance per feeder connection, plus one for the
 * Master. There is, logically, a LocalCBVLSNTracker instance associated
 * with each instance of the updater. The instance is local for an update
 * associated with a node in the Master state and is remote for each
 * Replica.</p>
 *
 * <p>The nodeCBVLSN can only increase during the lifetime of the
 * LocalCBVLSNUpdater instance. Note however that the value of the node's
 * CBVLSN as stored in the database, which represents the values from multiple
 * updaters associated with a node over its lifetime, may both decrease and
 * increase over its lifetime. The decreases are due primarily to rollbacks,
 * and should be relatively rare.</p>
 *
 * <p>The updaters used to maintain the Replica's local CBVLSNs are stored in
 * the Feeder.InputThread. The lifetime of such a LocalCBVLSNUpdater is
 * therefore determined by the lifetime of the connection between the Master
 * and the Replica. The node CBVLSN is updated each time a heart beat response
 * is processed by the FeederInput thread. It's also updated when an old Master
 * detects that a Replica needs a network restore. In this case, it updates
 * cbvlsn to the value expected from the node after a network restore so that
 * the global CBVLSN can continue to make forward progress and not hold up the
 * cleaner.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Master maintains an updater for its own CBVLSN in the FeederManager.
 * This updater exists as long as the node retains its Master state.</p>
 *
 * <p>Local CBVLSNs are used only to contribute to the calculation of the
 * global CBVLSN. The global CBVLSN acts as the cleaner throttle on old nodes.
 * Any invariants, such as the rule that the cleaner throttle cannot regress,
 * are applied when doing the global calculation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that CBVLSNs are not stored in the database for secondary nodes, but
 * transient information about them is still maintained.</p>
