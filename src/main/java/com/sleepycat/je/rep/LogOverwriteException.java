/**
 * Thrown when one or more log files are modified (overwritten) as the result 
 * of a replication operation. This occurs when a replication operation must
 * change existing data in a log file in order to synchronize with other nodes
 * in a replication group. Any previously copied log files may be invalid and 
 * should be discarded.
 *
 * <p>This exception is thrown by {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.util.DbBackup}. Backups and similar operations that copy
 * log files should discard any copied files when this exception occurs, and
 * may retry the operation at a later time. The time interval during which
 * backups are not possible will be fairly short (less than a minute).</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that this exception is never thrown in a standalone (non-replicated)
 * environment.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link com.sleepycat.je.Transaction} handle is <em>not</em>
 * invalidated as a result of this exception.</p>
