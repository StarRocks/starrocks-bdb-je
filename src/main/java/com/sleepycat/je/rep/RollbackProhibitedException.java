/**
 * This exception may be thrown by a Replica during the {@link <a
 * href="{@docRoot}/../ReplicationGuide/lifecycle.html#lifecycle-nodestartup">
 * replication stream sync-up</a>} phase of startup. It indicates that a syncup
 * cannot proceed without undoing a number of committed transactions that
 * exceeds the limit defined by {@link ReplicationConfig#TXN_ROLLBACK_LIMIT}.
 * <p>
 * It is rare for committed transactions to be rolled back during a
 * sync-up. One way this can happen is if a replication group has been
 * executing with a {@link com.sleepycat.je.Durability} policy that specifies a
 * {@link com.sleepycat.je.Durability.ReplicaAckPolicy ReplicaAckPolicy} of
 * NONE.
 * <p>
 * When ReplicaAckPolicy.NONE is specified, transactions can commit on the
 * master without receiving any acknowledgments from replica nodes. Using that
 * policy, it is possible that if the master node crashes at a given time, and
 * the group fails over and continues on with a new master, the old master's
 * environment will have transactions on disk that were never replicated and
 * received by other nodes. When this old master comes back up and rejoins the
 * group as a replica, it will have committed transactions that need to be
 * rolled back.
 * <p>
 * If the number of committed transactions to be rolled back is less than or
 * equal to the limit specified by {@link
 * ReplicationConfig#TXN_ROLLBACK_LIMIT}, JE will automatically truncate the
 * environment log to remove the unreplicated transactions, and will throw a
 * {@link RollbackException}. The application only needs to reinstantiate the
 * ReplicatedEnvironment and proceed on. If the limit specified by {@link
 * ReplicationConfig#TXN_ROLLBACK_LIMIT} is exceeded, the application will
 * receive a RollbackProhibitedException to indicate that manual intervention 
 * is required.
 * <p>
 * The RollbackProhibitedException lets the user interject application specific
 * processing before the log is truncated. The exception message and getter
 * methods indicate the number of transactions that must be rolled back, and
 * the time and id of the earliest targeted transaction, and the user can use
 * this information to make any desired application adjustments. The
 * application may then manually truncate the log using {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.util.DbTruncateLog}.
 * <p>
 * Note that any CommitTokens obtained before restarting this
 * <code>Replica</code> shouldn't be used after
 * {@link RollbackProhibitedException} is thrown because the token may no 
 * longer exist on the current <code>Master</code> node.
