/**
 * Specifies the attributes of an environment.
 *
 * <p>To change the default settings for a database environment, an application
 * creates a configuration object, customizes settings and uses it for
 * environment construction. The set methods of this class validate the
 * configuration values when the method is invoked.  An
 * IllegalArgumentException is thrown if the value is not valid for that
 * attribute.</p>
 *
 * <p>Most parameters are described by the parameter name String constants in
 * this class. These parameters can be specified or individually by calling
 * {@link #setConfigParam}, through a Properties object passed to {@link
 * #EnvironmentConfig(Properties)}, or via properties in the je.properties
 * files located in the environment home directory.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, an application can change the default btree node size
 * with:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     envConfig.setConfigParam(EnvironmentConfig.LOCK_TIMEOUT, "250 ms");
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Some commonly used environment attributes have convenience setter/getter
 * methods defined in this class.  For example, to change the default
 * lock timeout setting for an environment, the application can instead do
 * the following:</p>
 * <pre class=code>
 *     // customize an environment configuration
 *     EnvironmentConfig envConfig = new EnvironmentConfig();
 *     // will throw if timeout value is invalid
 *     envConfig.setLockTimeout(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
 *     // Open the environment using this configuration.
 *     Environment myEnvironment = new Environment(home, envConfig);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Parameter values are applied using this order of precedence:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Configuration parameters specified in je.properties take first
 *      precedence.</li>
 *     <li>Configuration parameters set in the EnvironmentConfig object used at
 *     Environment construction are next.</li>
 *     <li>Any configuration parameters not set by the application are set to
 *     system defaults, described along with the parameter name String
 *     constants in this class.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>However, a small number of parameters do not have string constants in
 * this class, and cannot be set using {@link #setConfigParam}, a Properties
 * object, or the je.properties file. These parameters can only be changed
 * via the following setter methods:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #setAllowCreate}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setCacheMode}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setClassLoader}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setCustomStats}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setExceptionListener}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setLoggingHandler}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setNodeName}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setRecoveryProgressListener}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>An EnvironmentConfig can be used to specify both mutable and immutable
 * environment properties.  Immutable properties may be specified when the
 * first Environment handle (instance) is opened for a given physical
 * environment.  When more handles are opened for the same environment, the
 * following rules apply:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Immutable properties must equal the original values specified when
 * constructing an Environment handle for an already open environment.  When a
 * mismatch occurs, an exception is thrown.</li>
 *     <li>Mutable properties are ignored when constructing an Environment handle
 * for an already open environment.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>After an Environment has been constructed, its mutable properties may be
 * changed using {@link Environment#setMutableConfig}.  See {@link
 * EnvironmentMutableConfig} for a list of mutable properties; all other
 * properties are immutable.  Whether a property is mutable or immutable is
 * also described along with the parameter name String constants in this
 * class.</p>
 *
 * <h4>Getting the Current Environment Properties</h4>
 *
 * To get the current "live" properties of an environment after constructing it
 * or changing its properties, you must call {@link Environment#getConfig} or
 * {@link Environment#getMutableConfig}.  The original EnvironmentConfig or
 * EnvironmentMutableConfig object used to set the properties is not kept up to
 * date as properties are changed, and does not reflect property validation or
 * properties that are computed.
 *
 * <h4><a name="timeDuration">Time Duration Properties</a></h4>
 *
 * <p>Several environment and transaction configuration properties are time
 * durations.  For these properties, a time unit is specified along with an
 * integer duration value.</p>
 *
 * <p>When specific setter and getter methods exist for a time duration
 * property, these methods have a {@link TimeUnit} argument.  Examples are
 * {@link #setLockTimeout(long,TimeUnit)} and {@link
 * #getLockTimeout(TimeUnit)}.  Note that the {@link TimeUnit} argument may
 * be null only when the duration value is zero; there is no default unit that
 * is used when null is specified.</p>
 *
 * <p>When a time duration is specified as a string value, the following format
 * is used.</p>
 *
 * <pre>   {@code <value> [ <whitespace> <unit> ]}</pre>
 *
 * <p>The {@code <value>} is an integer.  The {@code <unit>} name, if present,
 * must be preceded by one or more spaces or tabs.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following {@code <unit>} names are allowed.  Both {@link TimeUnit}
 * names and IEEE standard abbreviations are allowed.  Unit names are case
 * insensitive.</p>
 *
 * <table border="true">
 * <tr><th>IEEE abbreviation</th>
 *     <th>TimeUnit name</td>
 *     <th>Definition</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code ns}</td>
 *     <td>{@code NANOSECONDS}</td>

 * </tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code h}</td>
 *     <td>&nbsp;</td>
 *     <td>3600 seconds</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>Examples are:</p>
 * <pre>
 * 3 seconds
 * 3 s
 * 500 ms
 * 1000000 (microseconds is implied)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The maximum duration value is currently Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds.
 * This translates to almost 25 days (2147483647999999 ns, 2147483647999 us,
 * 2147483647 ms, 2147483 s, 35791 min, 596 h).</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that when the {@code <unit>} is omitted, microseconds is implied.
 * This default is supported for compatibility with JE 3.3 and earlier.  In JE
 * 3.3 and earlier, explicit time units were not used and durations were always
 * implicitly specified in microseconds.  The older methods that do not have a
 * {@link TimeUnit} argument, such as {@link #setLockTimeout(long)} and {@link
 * #getLockTimeout()}, use microsecond durations and have been deprecated.</p>

    /**
     * Configures the number of bytes to be used as a secondary, off-heap cache.
     *
     * The off-heap cache is used to hold record data and Btree nodes when
     * these are evicted from the "main cache" because it overflows. Eviction
     * occurs according to an LRU algorithm and takes into account the user-
     * specified {@link CacheMode}. When the off-heap cache overflows, eviction
     * occurs there also according to the same algorithm.
     * <p>
     * The main cache is in the Java heap and consists primarily of the Java
     * objects making up the in-memory Btree data structure. Btree objects are
     * not serialized the main cache, so no object materialization is needed to
     * access the Btree there. Access to records in the main cache is therefore
     * very fast, but the main cache has drawbacks as well: 1) The larger the
     * main cache, the more likely it is to have Java GC performance problems.
     * 2) When the Java heap exceeds 32GB, the "compressed OOPs" setting no
     * longer applies and less data will fit in the same amount of memory. For
     * these reasons, JE applications often configure a heap of 32GB or less,
     * and a main cache that is significantly less than 32GB, leaving any
     * additional machine memory for use by the file system cache.
     * <p>
     * The use of the file system cache has performance benefits, but
     * also has its own drawbacks: 1) There is a significant redundancy
     * between the main cache and the file system cache because all data and
     * Btree information that is logged (written) by JE appears in the file
     * system and may also appear in the main cache. 2) It is not possible
     * for <em>dirty</em> Btree information to be placed in the file system
     * cache without logging it, this logging may be otherwise unnecessary, and
     * the logging creates additional work for the JE cleaner; in other words,
     * the size of the main cache alone determines the maximum size of the
     * in-memory "dirty set".
     * <p>
     * The off-heap cache is stored outside the Java heap using a native
     * platform memory allocator. The current implementation relies on
     * internals that are specific to the Oracle and IBM JDKs; however, a
     * memory allocator interface that can be implemented for other situations
     * is being considered for a future release. Records and Btree objects are
     * serialized when they are placed in the off-heap cache, and they must be
     * materialized when they are moved back to the main cache in order to
     * access them. This serialization and materialization adds some CPU
     * overhead and thread contention, as compared to accessing data directly
     * in the main cache. The off-heap cache can contain dirty Btree
     * information, so it can be used to increase the maximum size of the
     * in-memory "dirty set".
     * <p>
     * NOTE: If an off-heap cache is configured but cannot be used because
     * that native allocator is not available in the JDK that is used, an
     * {@code IllegalStateException} will be thrown by the {@link Environment}
     * or {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicatedEnvironment} constructor. In
     * the current release, this means that the {@code sun.misc.Unsafe} class
     * must contain the {@code allocateMemory} method and related methods, as
     * defined in the Oracle JDK.
     * <p>
     * When configuring an off-heap cache you can think of the performance
     * trade-offs in two ways. First, if the off-heap cache is considered to be
     * a replacement for the file system cache, the serialization and
     * materialization overhead is not increased. In this case, the use of
     * the off-heap cache is clearly beneficial, and using the off-heap cache
     * "instead of" the file system cache is normally recommended. Second, the
     * off-heap cache can be used along with a main cache that is reduced in
     * size in order to compensate for Java GC problems. In this case, the
     * trade-off is between the additional serialization, materialization and
     * contention overheads of the off-heap cache, as compared to the Java GC
     * overhead.
     * <p>
     * When dividing up available memory for the JVM heap, the off-heap cache,
     * and for other uses, please be aware that the file system cache and the
     * off-heap cache are different in one important respect. The file system
     * cache automatically shrinks when memory is needed by the OS or other
     * processes, while the off-heap cache does not. Therefore, it is best to
     * be conservative about leaving memory free for other uses, and it is not
     * a good idea to size the off-heap cache such that all machine memory will
     * be allocated. If off-heap allocations or other allocations fail because
     * there is no available memory, the process is likely to die without any
     * exception being thrown. In one test on Linux, for example, the process
     * was killed abruptly by the OS and the only indication of the problem was
     * the following shown by {@code dmesg}.
     * <pre>

     * WARNING: Although this configuration property is mutable, it cannot be

     * In an HA environment, JE will retain as many reserved files as possible
     * to support replication to nodes that are out of contact. All cleaned
     * files are reserved (not deleted) until approaching a disk limit, at
     * which time they are deleted, as long as they are not protected.
     * Reserved files are protected when they are needed for
     * replication to active nodes or for feeding an active network restore.
     * <p>
     * For more information on reserved and protected data files, see
     * {@link EnvironmentStats#getActiveLogSize()},
     * {@link EnvironmentStats#getReservedLogSize()},
     * {@link EnvironmentStats#getProtectedLogSize()},

     * {@link EnvironmentStats#getTotalLogSize}.
     * <p>
     * When multiple JE environments share the same storage volume, the
     * FREE_DISK amount will be maintained for each environment. The following
     * scenario illustrates use of a single shared volume with capacity 300GB:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *     JE-1 and JE-2 each have MAX_DISK=100GB and FREE_DISK=5GB,
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *     100GB is used for fixed miscellaneous storage.
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Each JE environment will use no more than 95GB each, so at least 10GB
     * will remain free overall. In other words, if both JE environments reach
     * their threshold and write operations are prohibited, each JE environment
     * will have 5GB of free space for recovery (10GB total).
     * <p>
     * On the other hand, when an external service is also consuming disk
     * space and its usage of disk space is variable over time, the situation
     * is more complex and JE cannot always guarantee that FREE_DISK is
     * honored. The following scenario includes multiple JE environments as
     * well an external service, all sharing a 300GB volume.
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *     JE-1 and JE-2 each have MAX_DISK=100GB and FREE_DISK=5GB,
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *     an external service is expected to use up to 50GB, and
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *     50GB is used for fixed miscellaneous storage.
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Assuming that the external service stays within its 50GB limit then, as
     * the previous example, each JE environment will normally use no more than
     * 95GB each, and at least 10GB will remain free overall. However, if the
     * external service exceeds its threshold, JE will make a best effort to
     * prohibit write operations in order to honor the FREE_DISK limit, but
     * this is not always possible, as illustrated by the following sequence
     * of events:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *     If the external service uses all its allocated space, 50GB, and JE
     *     environments are each using 75GB, then there will be 50GB free
     *     overall (25GB for each JE environment). Write operations are allowed
     *     in both JE environments.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *     If the external service then exceeds its limit by 25GB and uses
     *     75GB, there will only 25GB free overall. But each JE environment is
     *     still under its 90GB limit and there is still more than 5GB free
     *     overall, so write operations are still allowed.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *     If each JE environment uses an additional 10GB of space, there will
     *     only be 5GB free overall. Each JE environment is using only 85GB,
     *     which is under its 95GB limit. But the 5GB FREE_DISK limit for the
     *     volume overall has been reached and therefore JE write operations
     *     will be prohibited.
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
     * Leaving only 5GB of free space in the prior scenario is not ideal, but
     * it is at least enough for one JE environment at a time to be recovered.
     * The reality is that when an external entity exceeds its expected disk
     * usage, JE cannot always compensate. For example, if the external service
     * continues to use more space in the scenario above, the volume will
     * eventually be filled completely.

     *
     * <p>A read-only environment has several limitations and is recommended
     * only in special circumstances.  Note that there is no performance
     * advantage to opening an environment read-only.</p>
     *
     * <p>The primary reason for opening an environment read-only is to open a
     * single environment in multiple JVM processes.  Only one JVM process at a
     * time may open the environment read-write.  See {@link
     * EnvironmentLockedException}.</p>
     *
     * <p>When the environment is open read-only, the following limitations
     * apply.</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>In the read-only environment no writes may be performed, as
     * expected, and databases must be opened read-only using {@link
     * DatabaseConfig#setReadOnly}.</li>
     * <li>The read-only environment receives a snapshot of the data that is
     * effectively frozen at the time the environment is opened. If the
     * application has the environment open read-write in another JVM process
     * and modifies the environment's databases in any way, the read-only
     * version of the data will not be updated until the read-only JVM process
     * closes and reopens the environment (and by extension all databases in
     * that environment).</li>
     * <li>If the read-only environment is opened while the environment is in
     * use by another JVM process in read-write mode, opening the environment
     * read-only (recovery) is likely to take longer than it does after a clean
     * shutdown.  This is due to the fact that the read-write JVM process is
     * writing and checkpoints are occurring that are not coordinated with the
     * read-only JVM process.  The effect is similar to opening an environment
     * after a crash.</li>
     * <li>In a read-only environment, the JE cache will contain information
     * that cannot be evicted because it was reconstructed by recovery and

     * the key of the record and the most recent disk address of that record.
     * Records and INs share the disk space (are stored in the same kind of

     * clustering or co-location of a BIN and its child LNs.
     * <p>

     * of a record is a dynamic property: a size-changing update may turn a
     * non-embedded record to an embedded one or vice-versa.
     * <p>
     * Notice that even though a record may be embedded, when the record is
     * inserted, updated, or deleted an LN for that record is still generated
     * and written to disk. This is because LNs also act as log records,
     * which are needed during recovery and/or transaction abort to undo/redo
     * operations that are/are-not currently reflected in the BINs. However,
     * during normal processing, these LNs will never be fetched from disk.
     * <p>
     * Obviously, embedding records has the performance advantage that no
     * extra disk read is needed to fetch the record data (i.e., the LN)
     * during read operations. This is especially true for operations like
     * cursor scans and for random searches within key ranges whose
     * containing BINs can fit in the JE cache (in other words when there
     * is locality of reference). Furthermore, embedded records do not need
     * to be migrated during cleaning; they are considered obsolete by default,
     * because they will never be needed again after their containing log file
     * is deleted. This makes cleaning faster, and more importantly, avoids
     * the dirtying of the parent BINs, which would otherwise cause even more
     * cleaning later.
     * <p>
     * On the other hand, embedded LNs make the BINs larger, which can lead to
     * more cache eviction of BINs and the associated performance problems.
     * When eviction does occur, performance can deteriorate as the size of
     * the data portion of the records grows. This is especially true for
     * insertion-only workloads. Therefore, increasing the value of 
     * TREE_MAX_EMBEDDED_LN beyond the default value of 16 bytes should be
     * done "carefully": by considering the kind of workloads that will be run
     * against BDB-JE and their relative importance and expected response
     * times, and by running performance tests with both embedded and
     * non-embedded LNs.

    /**
     * Specifies the maximum unprefixed key length for use in the compact
     * in-memory key representation.
     *
     * <p>In the Btree, the JE in-memory cache, the default representation for
     * keys uses a byte array object per key.  The per-key object overhead of
     * this approach ranges from 20 to 32 bytes, depending on the JVM
     * platform.</p>
     *
     * <p>To reduce memory overhead, a compact representation can instead be
     * used where keys will be represented inside a single byte array instead
     * of having one byte array per key. Within the single array, all keys are
     * assigned a storage size equal to that taken up by the largest key, plus
     * one byte to hold the actual key length.  The use of the fixed size array
     * reduces Java GC activity as well as memory overhead.</p>
     *
     * <p>In order for the compact representation to reduce memory usage, all
     * keys in a database, or in a Btree internal node, must be roughly the
     * same size.  The more fully populated the internal node, the more the
     * savings with this representation since the single byte array is sized to
     * hold the maximum number of keys in the internal node, regardless of the
     * actual number of keys that are present.</p>
     *
     * <p>It's worth noting that the storage savings of the compact
     * representation are realized in addition to the storage benefits of key
     * prefixing (if it is configured), since the keys stored in the key array
     * are the smaller key values after the prefix has been stripped, reducing
     * the length of the key and making it more likely that it's small enough
     * for this specialized representation.  This configuration parameter
     * ({@code TREE_COMPACT_MAX_KEY_LENGTH}) is the maximum key length, not
     * including the common prefix, for the keys in a Btree internal node
     * stored using the compact representation.  See {@link
     * DatabaseConfig#setKeyPrefixing}.</p>
     *
     * <p>The compact representation is used automatically when both of the
     * following conditions hold.</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>All keys in a Btree internal node must have an unprefixed length
     * that is less than or equal to the length specified by this parameter
     * ({@code TREE_COMPACT_MAX_KEY_LENGTH}).</li>
     * <li>If key lengths vary by large amounts within an internal node, the
     * wasted space of the fixed length storage may negate the benefits of the
     * compact representation and cause more memory to be used than with the
     * default representation.  In that case, the default representation will
     * be used.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If this configuration parameter is set to zero, the compact
     * representation will not be used.</p>
     *
     * <p>The default value of this configuration parameter is 16 bytes.  The
     * potential drawbacks of specifying a larger length are:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Insertion and deletion for larger keys move bytes proportional to
     * the storage length of the keys.</li>
     * <li>With the compact representation, all operations create temporary
     * byte arrays for each key involved in the operation.  Larger byte arrays
     * mean more work for the Java GC, even though these objects are short
     * lived.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Mutation of the key representation between the default and compact
     * approaches is automatic on a per-Btree internal node basis.  For
     * example, if a key that exceeds the configured length is added to a node
     * that uses the compact representation, the node is automatically
     * mutated to the default representation.  A best effort is made to
     * prevent frequent mutations that could increase Java GC activity.</p>
     *
     * <p>To determine how often the compact representation is used in a

    /**
     * Whether to perform deadlock detection when a lock conflict occurs.
     * By default, deadlock detection is enabled (this parameter is true) in
     * order to reduce thread wait times when there are deadlocks.
     * <p>
     * Deadlock detection is performed as follows.
     * <ol>
     *   <li>When a lock is requested by a record read or write operation, JE
     *       checks for lock conflicts with another transaction or another
     *       thread performing a non-transactional operation. If there is no
     *       conflict, the lock is acquired and the operation returns
     *       normally.</li>
     *   <li>When there is a conflict, JE performs deadlock detection. However,
     *       before performing deadlock detection, JE waits for the
     *       {@link #LOCK_DEADLOCK_DETECT_DELAY} interval, if it is non-zero.
     *       This delay is useful for avoiding the overhead of deadlock
     *       detection when normal, short-lived contention (not a deadlock) is
     *       the reason for the conflict. If the lock is acquired during the
     *       delay, the thread wakes up and the operation returns
     *       normally.</li>
     *   <li>If a deadlock is detected, {@link DeadlockException} is thrown in
     *       one of the threads participating in the deadlock, called the
     *       "victim". The victim is chosen at random to prevent a repeated
     *       pattern of deadlocks, called "live lock". A non-victim thread that
     *       detects a deadlock will notify the victim and perform short
     *       delays, waiting for the deadlock to be broken; if the lock is
     *       acquired, the operation returns normally.</li>
     *   <li>It is possible for live lock to occur in spite of using random
     *       victim selection. It is also possible that a deadlock is not
     *       broken because the victim thread is unresponsive or the
     *       application fails to close a cursor or to commit or abort a
     *       transaction. In these cases, if the lock or transaction timeout
     *       expires without acquiring the lock, a {@code DeadlockException} is
     *       thrown for the last deadlock detected, in the thread that detected
     *       the deadlock. In this case, {@code DeadlockException} may be
     *       thrown by more than one thread participating in the deadlock.
     *       </li>
     *   <li>When no deadlock is detected, JE waits for the lock or transaction
     *       timeout to expire. If the lock is acquired during this delay, the
     *       thread wakes up and the operation returns normally.</li>
     *   <li>When the lock or transaction timeout expires without acquiring the
     *       lock, JE checks for deadlocks one final time. If a deadlock is
     *       detected, {@code DeadlockException} is thrown; otherwise,
     *       {@link LockTimeoutException} or
     *       {@link TransactionTimeoutException}is thrown.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * Deadlock detection may be disabled (by setting this parameter to false)
     * in applications that are known to be free of deadlocks, and this may
     * provide a slight performance improvement in certain scenarios. However,
     * this is not recommended because deadlock-free operation is difficult to
     * guarantee. If deadlock detection is disabled, JE skips steps 2, 3 and 4
     * above. However, deadlock detection is always performed in the last step,
     * and {@code DeadlockException} may be thrown.
