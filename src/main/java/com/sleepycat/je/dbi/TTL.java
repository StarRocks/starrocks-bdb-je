/**
 * Internal documentation and utility functions for the TTL feature.
 *
 * Repeatable-read
 * -----------------
 * As described in {@link WriteOptions#setTTL}, repeatable-read is supported
 * in simple cases by treating a record that expires after being locked as if
 * it were not expired. This is implemented and documented in {@link
 * CursorImpl#lockLN}.
 *
 * Unfortunately, we must check for whether a lock is already owned or shared
 * by the locker before we attempt to lock the record. To optimize and avoid
 * this extra overhead when it is unnecessary, we only do this when a record
 * might expire during the transaction, according to the {@link
 * EnvironmentParams#ENV_TTL_MAX_TXN_TIME} threshold.
 *
 * When a slot contains an expired record, {@link CursorImpl#lockLN} returns
 * true in the LockStanding.defunct field, just as it does for deleted records.
 * That way deleted records and expired records are filtered out of queries in
 * the same way.
 *
 * Locking (read or write locks) also protects a record from being purged. The
 * cleaner only considers an LN expired if its lock is uncontended, meaning
 * that it could write-lock it. It places locked LNs on the pending LN queue.
 * The compressor also only removes an expired slot if its lock is uncontended.
 *
 * However, if the clock was changed, purging may have occurred. Therefore,
 * when an LN being fetched is in a cleaned file (LOG_FILE_NOT_FOUND), we treat
 * it as a deleted record if it expires within {@link
 * EnvironmentParams#ENV_TTL_CLOCK_TOLERANCE}. Records for which {@link
 * IN#fetchLN} returns null must also be filtered out of queries. This can
 * happen even after locking the record and determining that the slot is not
 * expired.
 *
 * To prevent an LN from being purged while an operation is attempting to lock
 * it, due to thread scheduling, we purge LNs only if they are already expired
 * by at least {@link EnvironmentParams#ENV_TTL_MAX_TXN_TIME}. This is done to
 * compensate for the fact that the BIN is latched by the cleaner when locking
 * an expired LN, while all other LN locking does latch the BIN. This also
 * means that, when calculating utilization of a .jdb file, we don't consider
 * LNs expired until the ENV_TTL_MAX_TXN_TIME after their expiration time.
 *
 * There are several special cases involving LNs discovered to be purged after
 * locking the record. In the cases where the operation fails, the situation
 * is documented in {@link WriteOptions#setTTL}.
 *
 *  + For a read operation with a non-null 'data' param, if the LN was
 *    previously locked but the data was not requested, and the LN is found to
 *    be purged during the read, the operation fails (returns null).
 *
 *  + For an update operation with a partial 'data' param, if the LN was
 *    previously locked (but the data was not requested), and the LN is found
 *    to be purged during the update, the operation fails (returns null).
 *
 *  + For an update of a primary record with secondary keys, if the record is
 *    locked and then we find the LN has been purged, we simply don't delete
 *    any pre-existing secondary keys. This is OK because those secondary
 *    records are also expired and will be purged naturally.
 *
 * Note that when the expiration time is reduced, including setting it to zero,
 * no special handling is needed. The update operation itself will ensure that
 * the expiration time in the BIN and LN are in sync, in the case of a single
 * record, and that a primary record and its associated and secondary records
 * have expiration times that are in sync. Since expiration checking always
 * occurs after locking, the updated expiration time will always be used.
 *
 * Secondaries
 * -----------
 * Locking also supports repeatable-read for secondaries, as long as the
 * records being accessed were locked. To make this work when reading via a
 * secondary, we must lock the secondary if it expires within
 * {@link EnvironmentParams#ENV_TTL_MAX_TXN_TIME}. Normally we don't lock the
 * secondary at all in this case, and rely only on the primary record lock.
 * This extra lock is taken after the primary lock, so locking order it not
 * violated, i.e., this does not increase the potential for deadlocks.
 *
 * When reading via a secondary, if the secondary exists but the primary record
 * expired (within {@link EnvironmentParams#ENV_TTL_CLOCK_TOLERANCE}), then we
 * we treat the record as deleted.
 *
 * When updating or deleting a primary record and its associated secondary
 * records, we ignore integrity problems if the secondary record has expired
 * (within {@link EnvironmentParams#ENV_TTL_CLOCK_TOLERANCE}). Specifically
 * we ignore the integrity error when: 1. we are deleting the secondary record
 * and it does not exist; 2. we are updating secondary record and it does not
 * exist -- in this case we insert it.
