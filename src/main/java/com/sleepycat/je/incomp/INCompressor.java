/**
 * JE compression consists of removing BIN slots for deleted and expired
 * records, and pruning empty IN/BINs from the tree which is also called a
 * reverse split.
 *
 * One of the reasons compression is treated specially is that slot compression
 * cannot be performed inline as part of a delete operation.  When we delete an
 * LN, a cursor is always present on the LN.  The API dictates that the cursor
 * will remain positioned on the deleted record.  In addition, if the deleting
 * transaction aborts we must restore the slot and the possibility of a split
 * during an abort is something we wish to avoid; for this reason, compression
 * will not occur if the slot's LSN is locked.  In principle, slot compression
 * could be performed during transaction commit, but that would be expensive
 * because a Btree lookup would be required, and this would negatively impact
 * operation latency.  For all these reasons, slot compression is performed
 * after the delete operation is complete and committed, and not in the thread
 * performing the operation or transaction commit.
 *
 * Compression is of two types:
 *
 * + "Queued compression" is carried out by the INCompressor daemon thread.
 *    Both slot compression and pruning are performed.
 *
 * + "Lazy compression" is carried out opportunistically at various times when
 *    compression is beneficial.
 *
 * The use of BIN-deltas has a big impact on slot compression because dirty
 * slots cannot be compressed until we know that a full BIN will be logged
 * next. If a dirty slot were compressed prior to logging a BIN-delta, the
 * record of the compression would be lost and the slot would "reappear" when
 * the BIN is reconstituted. Normally we do not compress dirty slots when a
 * delta would next be logged. However, there are times when we do compress
 * dirty slots, and in that case the "prohibit next logged delta" flag is set
 * on the BIN.
 *
 * Queued compression prior to logging a BIN-delta is also wasteful because the
 * dequeued entry cannot be processed.  Therefore, lazy compression is relied
 * on when a BIN-delta will next be logged.  Because, BIN-deltas are logged
 * more often than BINs, lazy compression is used for slot compression more
 * often than queued compression.
 *
 * Lazy compression is used for compressing expired slots, in addition to
 * deleted slots. This is done opportunistically as described above. Expired
 * slots are normally not dirty, so they can often be compressed even when a
 * BIN will be logged next as a BIN-delta. The same is true of deleted slots
 * that are not dirty, although these occur infrequently.
 *
 * Since we don't lazy-compress BIN-deltas, how can we prevent their expired
 * slots from using space for long time periods? Currently the expired space
 * will be reclaimed only when the delta is mutated to a full BIN and then
 * compressed, including when the full BIN is cleaned. This is the same as
 * reclaiming space for deleted slots, so this is acceptable for now at least.
 *
 * You may wonder, since lazy compression is necessary, why use queued
 * compression for slot compression at all? Queued compression is useful for
 * the following reasons:
 *
 * + If a BIN-delta will not be logged next, queued compression will cause the
 *   compression to occur sooner than with lazy compression.
 *
 * + When a cursor is on a BIN or a deleted entry is locked during lazy
 *   compression, we cannot compress the slot. Queuing allows it to be
 *   compressed sooner than if we waited for the next lazy compression.
 *
 * + The code to process a queue entry must do slot compression anyway, even if
 *   we only want to prune the BIN.  We have to account for the case where all
 *   slots are deleted but not yet compressed.  So the code to process the
 *   queue entry could not be simplified even if we were to decide not to queue
 *   entries for slot compression.
